# Android Basics Nanodegree by Google
This is an Android nanodegree I've completed on Udacity to recall some of the Android basics:

This course includes:
* Android Basics: User Interface
* Android Basics: User Input
* Android Basics: Multi-Screen Apps
* Android Basics: Networking
* (additional) Android Basics: Data Storage

Disclaimer: 
I did all of the free courses that made up this Android Basics nanodegree. 
The only difference between paid and free versions is the lack of project reviews and feedback.
However, considering my previous experience with Android Devolopment, I didn't face any problems
while following these courses or building projects.
